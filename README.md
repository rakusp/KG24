# data.europa.eu datasets quality analysis
## Created as a part of the Knowledge Graphs course 2024/25 at the Faculaty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology
This project provides a proposed way of analyzing the quality of the datasets available on the [data.europa website](data.europa.eu) - an official European Union platform containing datasets.
By using SPARQL and python we were able to extract features from gthe metadata of the datasets, represented as knowledge graph. This led to an analysis were we have tried to detect the best and worst publishers, in terms of the quality of the data. We have relied on the FAIR principles for determining features that make a dataset be of high quality. For more detailed description and demonstrative analysis, refer to the `publishers_analysis.ipynb` file
